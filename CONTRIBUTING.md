# Contributing

## Workflow

- **Did you find a bug?**

  Awesome! Please feel free to open an issue first, or if you have a fix open a
  pull request that describes the bug with code that demonstrates the bug in a
  test and addresses it.

- **Do you want to add a feature?**

  Features begin life as a proposal. Please open a pull request with a proposal
  that explains the feature, its use case, considerations, and design. This will
  allow interested contributors to weigh in, refine the idea, and ensure there's
  no wasted time in the event a feature doesn't fit with our direction.

## Setup

- Ensure you're using golang 1.9+.

  ```console
  go version
  ```

- Install [`dep`][dep] if not present on your system. See their [installation
  instructions][dep-install] and [releases page][dep-releases] for details.

- Install the source code from GitHub

  ```console
  go get github.com/masterxavierfox/fargate
  ```

- Run `dep ensure` to install required dependencies

  ```console
  cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/masterxavierfox/fargate
  dep ensure
  ```

- Make sure you can run the tests

  ```console
  make test
  ```

## Testing

- Tests can be run via `go test` or `make test`

- To generate mocks as you add functionality, run `make mocks` or use `go
  generate` directly

## Building

- To build a binary for your platform run `make`

- For cross-building for all supported platforms, run `make dist` which builds
  binaries for darwin (64-bit) and linux (Arm, 32-bit, 64-bit).
